# Contributing to SCSS-mixins

We love contributions from everyone. **Here's how you can help.**

Please take a moment to read this document to make the contribution process easier and more effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.

## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/7ninjas/scss-mixins/issues) is
the best way for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests)
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests). Please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests.

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

* Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:". Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments)
  instead. We reserve the right to delete comments which violate this rule.


## Issues and labels

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels to help organize and identify issues. They are categorized by type, status and priority.

For a complete look at our labels, see the [project labels page](https://github.com/7ninjas/scss-mixins/issues/labels?sort=name-asc).


## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `develop` branch in the repository.


A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. 
For sure we need to know:
* what behavior you expected and was actual result
* version used
* browser Name and version
* operating System and version (desktop or mobile)
* link to your project (optionally)

All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome, but please note that they **must target
actual version** of project.

Before opening a feature request, please take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.


## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work
included in the project:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes.
   - Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   - Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   - Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream.

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change or fix.

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely to be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch.

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork.

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to
license your work under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE).
